Hi [Hiring Manager],

My name is Mykhailo Tverdokhlibov. 
I'm an aspiring NLP/AI Engineer with a background in software development and a deep interest in real-world applications of language technologies.

Iâ€™ve already built personal projects in NLP, such as a Ukrainian news text converter for preprocessing and analysis. 
My focus is on building AI-based systems â€” from text pipelines to chatbot/LLM-based automation tools. 
Iâ€™m currently learning PyTorch, HuggingFace, and vector database integration to expand my impact in this field.

My long-term goal is to work on impactful AI technologies and eventually contribute to visionary projects like The Venus Project. 
Iâ€™m excited to grow with a team working on challenging, meaningful AI problems.

Please find my resume attached. Iâ€™d be happy to talk further.

Best regards,  
Mykhailo Tverdokhlibov
